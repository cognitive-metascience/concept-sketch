The big dog runs quickly in the park.
The small cat sleeps on the warm bed.
A beautiful house stands on the hill.
The old man walks slowly through the garden.
Dogs chase cats in the street.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
I see a big beautiful house near the river.
The children play happily in the yard.
A lovely flower grows in the meadow.
The weather changes quickly in spring.
Birds fly high in the blue sky.
The happy child receives a nice gift.
Beautiful paintings hang on the old wall.
Fast cars drive on the busy highway.
The teacher explains the lesson clearly.
Quiet students read interesting books in the library.
Heavy rain falls on the city at night.
The strong wind blows from the north.
A strange noise wakes me up early.
The hungry cat meows loudly at the door.
